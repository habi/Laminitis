Limb05

This hoof was scanned several times.
The first scan (`proj_orig`) was stopped in segment 2 of 3, due to RAM failure of the control PC.
This set of projections was 'massaged' by removing all traces of the failed third scan and copied to the `proj` folder.
These reconstructions are in the `rec` folder.
A while later we scanned the sample again into `proj02`, but this scan also crashed at segment 3 of 3.
Then we've started a scan with heavily optimizing the field of view (`proj03`), and reconstructed into `rec03`.
